# Indexers in Python

This is Python source folder of the hspsdb-indexer project.

We have the following two scripts, _both at early stages of development_

* [indexHSPs.py](indexHSPs.py): index similarity search results
 in tabular format, e.g. generated by [Lambda](https://github.com/seqan/lambda/),
 [BlastX](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
 or [Diamond](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)


* [indexbam.py](indexbam.py): index SAM BAM files with MongoDB

  BAM files reading was initially based on
  [pybam](https://github.com/JohnLonginotto/pybam) library,
  latest version reads both BAM and SAM files by calling
  [pysam](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) library functions
