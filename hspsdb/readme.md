# Index scripts

This is Python source folder of the hspsdb project.

We have the following two scripts

* [indexHSPs.py](indexHSPs.py): Index similarity search results
 in tabular format, e.g. generated by [Lambda](https://github.com/seqan/lambda),
 [BlastX](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov),
 or [Diamond](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)

* [queryHSPs.py](queryHSPs.py): Query indexed similarity search results,
  find most represented genes and present them using PivotTable.js
  
 ```bash
./hspsdb/queryHSPs.py topgenes  study1-diamond  study1-diamond-topgenes -b 120
 ```


* [indexbam.py](indexbam.py): Index SAM BAM files with MongoDB,
  _at early stages of development_

  BAM files reading was initially based on
  [pybam](https://github.com/JohnLonginotto/pybam) library,
  latest version reads both BAM and SAM files by calling
  [pysam](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) library functions
