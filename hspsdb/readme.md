This is Python source folder of the hspsdb-indexer project

For now we only have the following script 

* indexbam.py: index BAM files, based on
  [pybam](https://github.com/JohnLonginotto/pybam) library

There are also other Python BAM parsers that we have not tried yet:
* https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam
* https://bitbucket.org/aroth85/pybam (last updated in 2012)
* https://bitbucket.org/dan/pybamparser
