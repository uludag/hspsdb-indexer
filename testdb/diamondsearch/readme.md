This folder includes sample search outputs generated by the sequence aligner
[DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/)

We want to support all bioinformatics tools that support BLAST XML output
format or the SAM Sequence Alignment/Map format.
DIAMOND supports both output formats so we support DIAMOND.
