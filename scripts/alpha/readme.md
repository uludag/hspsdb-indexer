This folder includes scripts which are at early stages of development

* indexbam.py: script for indexing BAM files, dependent on
 [pybam](https://github.com/JohnLonginotto/pybam) library

* index-mongodb.js: script for indexing BLAST json output files with MongoDB


There are also other Python BAM parsers on Bitbucket that we have not checked yet:

* https://bitbucket.org/aroth85/pybam
* https://bitbucket.org/dan/pybamparser

TODO:
* pybam readme file recommends using PyPy for running their library,
  for faster execution speed
